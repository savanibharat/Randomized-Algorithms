The sequence in generated algorithmatically using finite preceision arithmatic so it is neither random nor infinite
The method used is linear congruential random number generator

Seed value is X0(0<=X0<m)
m is a number by which the function is moded.

		Xi+1=(aXi+c) mod m
		
chose a as prime (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,....)
Why?

Prime number always gurantees that keys generated will be uniformly distributed.
